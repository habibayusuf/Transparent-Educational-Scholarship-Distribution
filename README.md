# Transparent Educational Scholarship Distribution

## Overview

This blockchain-based platform revolutionizes educational scholarship management by creating a fully transparent and efficient system for connecting donors with qualified students. The platform ensures that funds are distributed fairly, recipients meet eligibility requirements, and academic progress is properly monitoredâ€”all with minimal administrative overhead.

The system operates through four specialized smart contracts:

1. **Donor Management Contract**: Records contributions to scholarship funds
2. **Student Verification Contract**: Validates qualifications of applicants
3. **Award Allocation Contract**: Manages selection and distribution of funds
4. **Academic Progress Contract**: Tracks performance of scholarship recipients

## Key Features

- **Complete Transparency**: All stakeholders can verify fund allocation and usage
- **Reduced Administrative Costs**: Automated processes minimize overhead expenses
- **Merit-Based Distribution**: Objective criteria ensure fair selection
- **Accountability**: Continuous tracking of academic performance
- **Direct Connection**: Donors can see the impact of their contributions
- **Fraud Prevention**: Multi-layered verification prevents misrepresentation

## How It Works
